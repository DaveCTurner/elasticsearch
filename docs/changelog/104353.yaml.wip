deprecation:
  title: Deprecate `LoggingTaskListener`
  area: Logging
  details: >-
    Logs from `org.elasticsearch.tasks.LoggingTaskListener` contain very little
    information which makes them very hard to use. Moreover, the information it
    reports is also available, and much easier to consume, when using the Task
    Management APIs instead. This logger is deprecated, and will be removed in
    the next major version.
  impact: >-

    * Use the task management APIs to obtain the status of long-running tasks.

    * Set the `?log_task_completion=false` query parameter when calling the
    affected APIs to disable the deprecated logger and suppress the deprecation
    warning.
