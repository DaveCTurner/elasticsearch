deprecation:
  title: Deprecate `LoggingTaskListener`
  area: Logging
  details: >-
    Logs from `org.elasticsearch.tasks.LoggingTaskListener` contain very little
    information which makes them very hard to use. Moreover, the information it
    reports is also available, and much easier to consume, when using the Task
    Management APIs instead. This logger is deprecated, and will be removed in
    the next major version. Set `tasks.logging_task_listener.enabled` to
    `false` on every node to disable this logger and suppress the deprecation
    warning.
  impact: >-

    * Use the task management APIs to obtain the status of long-running tasks.

    * Set `tasks.logging_task_listener.enabled` to `false` to disable this
      logger and suppress the deprecation warning
